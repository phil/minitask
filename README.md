# minitask
A simple CLI task program that you should never actually use

Writen in simple portable Ruby.

## What works

- Adding tasks
- Take tasks
- Complete tasks

## What else can it do?

- Self update

## What needs finishing?

- Tests

## Why?

Okay, so this is not a serious tool that anyone should ever actually consider using. There are much better tools for tracking tasks.

Think of minitask more as a technology experiment. Ruby is not well know for it's portability, but this app _should_ run as long as a relatively modern Ruby is installed

## Really?

Yes really.

## Examples

```
som ereally long long Lorem ipsum som ereally long long Lorem ipsum som ereally long long Lorem ipsum som ereally long long Lorem ipsum som ereally long long Lorem ipsum som ereally long long Lorem ipsum som ereally long long Lorem ipsum command
```
